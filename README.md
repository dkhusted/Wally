## General Information
- The project propose an different approch to smart homes. Instead of using voice commands to get different kinds of information via a traditional smart-home device, like Alexy or Google Home, Wally will use sign language to determine the user request. 
- The reason for this is to inable people with the mute dissability to also have access to an smart home device, and that image processing would be more reliable than audio since bagground noice, such as other people or tv, would not have an effect. The only noice factor would be the light level.

## Technologies Used
Microprocessor: Particle Argon
IDE: Visual Studio Code



## Features
List the ready features here:

## Requirements
For this project the following requirements have been specified.

### Camera
Minimum distance for correct image recognition: 1.5 m.
Pixel resolution: 343 pixels.
Low power design.
Should be able to detec objects moving 1.5 m/s, based on average walking speed for a person between 20-30.
### MCU 
Low power design.
When no object movement have been detected, should enter low power mode.
Has to be able to run a Machine learning algorithme for image classification. Images will be live stream
Response time from low power to finishing image classification: <20 sec
